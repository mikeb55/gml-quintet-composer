<h1>v3.2 - Bass and Rhythm Fixed</h1>
<p>This version fixes the critical issues from v3.1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bass now plays actual notes (not rests)</li>
<li>Each voice has independent rhythm patterns</li>
<li>Cello range corrected</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, use v3.1 and manually fix the bass in Sibelius after import.</p>
